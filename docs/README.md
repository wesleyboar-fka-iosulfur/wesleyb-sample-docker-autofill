# Schoology Autofill Project - Docs

Here should have only directories, within which are service-specific documentation.

> **To Do**

## Directories

These directories are automatically maintained.

        |_ service                 // the web server
        |_ docs                    // the client-side web app
            |_ tutorial-API.html   // the server-side web API
