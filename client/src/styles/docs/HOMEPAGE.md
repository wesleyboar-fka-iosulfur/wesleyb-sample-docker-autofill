# Schoology Autofill - UI Pattern Library

This is a pattern library for the project. The patterns are organized via [ITCSS][itcss].

> **Known Issues**
> - Minor typos probably exist.
> - Example markup is not rendered.
>     - _This is because docs need compiled stylesheet with static name and comments, which is unavailable without customizing build process (already over time, so I will not do this)._
