/*
progress-color
(selector, fill, background, border)

Set the colors of a progress bar. _[Indeterminite](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:indeterminate) progress bars are transparent._

$selector - (required) A selector that captures the element to be colored
$fill - The value for the progress bar fill color
$background  - The value for the progress bar background color
$border  - The value for the progress bar border color

This mixins assigns the colors (to the given selector) using cross-browser supported methods for setting color. Shorthand values are allowed, and supported as browser supports themâ€”_**but**, this mixin makes no attempt to "fix" values for browsers.

To __not__ set any value (except selector, which is required), use the value `null`. _A blank parameter will be used as if it were a value._
