/*
Field

Wrapper for a `<label>` and a user-entry field (`<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`, etc) and any directly related elements (error text, field-specific loading UI, field-specific `<output>`).

This component exists for a few reasons:
- Layout
    - Often, labels and inputs are treated as a block together, which requires a wrapper element.
- Accessibility
    - A user-entry field **should** have a label to describe the field.
    - The label for a user-entry field **should not** contain the field.
- Organization
    - A `<fieldset>` can have a set of `.c-field`s.
