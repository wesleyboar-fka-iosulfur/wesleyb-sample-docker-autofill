# Schoology Autofill - Server Data

This is static server-side data storage for the web services.

Data can come:
- dynamically from scripts
- statically from flat-files _(see [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](./KNOWN_ISSUES.md))_

## Directories

These directories are manually maintained.

    ./
        |_ dynamic // scripts for dynamic data
        |_ static  // static file data storage
